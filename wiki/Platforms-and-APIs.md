Here we list all the APIs and platforms we have considered. It is a serious time sink to research the suitability of a platform, so with the reasons we have kept or rejected, or put  each on hold.


# Frontend


HTML5 is extremely powerful. It has a lot of new widgets (under form elements: sliders, numbers, dates, file uploaders, also <progress> and <meter> which lists). We can probably [build](../../scratch/html5/widgets) most of our widgets direct in the DOM.

* LessCSS
* craftyjs?
* [TogetherJS](https://togetherjs.com/) by Mozilla for adding commenting throughout a site
* [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) to let us write one codebase against HTML5

* Promises: [overview of some of the better implementations](http://www.promisejs.org/implementations/) / [a different site??](http://promisesaplus.com/implementations)
  * ayepromise (**<-- current**)
  * when.js
  * promise.js
  * ....

**Layout Templates**
* [Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

* [Polymer](http://www.polymer-project.org/), a javascript hack + project that **adds new HTML tags** like "<google-map>" and "<chart>", with extensibility in mind. This finally adds includes to HTML5, and it does it targetting all the modern power of the modern DOM.

## Visualization

* [Vispy](http://vispy.org/) (_not a frontend possibility, but targetted at real-time big-data and interactivity, so good to keep in mind_)

## Javascript Data View/Flow/Binding Libraries  (an obscene number of them)

Since our problem is so data-centric, not using data-binding will be a giant pain of always writing new update handlers. 

A data bind and a data flow are related problems, and several of these libraries solve them together. A data _bind_ is when some object (something in-memory or output like a visualization widget or a slider) is marked as being a consumer of some other object, and they are kept in sync. A data _flow_ is a chain of dependent computations; most useful of all is a flow over a series of binds (_think: Microsoft Excel, which lets you edit any non-formula cell and then reupdated all dependent cells automatically; and that is **really, really useful**_)

**Question**: do we support bidirectional binds? Bidirectional binds are much much much harder than unidirectional; the alternative is to manually expose an API for everything modifiable (and this is safer, because is gaurds against accidentally making a model--which is more likely than not written quick-and-dirty--inconsistent)

* [LavaJS](http://lava.codeplex.com/) - _this one is promising; it is small and claims to be unobtrusive
* http://jqxb.codeplex.com/
* [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/); 
  * rave reviews [here](http://blog.stevensanderson.com/2010/07/05/introducing-knockout-a-ui-library-for-javascript/) and [here](http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2012/02/01/2-great-javascript-data-binding-libraries.aspx)
  * supports functional definitions of quantities--quantities that get recomputed as the underlying data updates
* [jsViews](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jsviews) seems to be jQuery's official plugin to do this 
* [simpli5](https://github.com/jacwright/simpli5) is a bigger thing, but it [features data-binding](http://jacwright.com/438/javascript-data-binding/). It hasn't had an update in 4 years, though (perhaps jQuery superseded it?). Regardless, we can pick through it (and the others) for ideas.; [its magic](https://github.com/jacwright/simpli5/blob/master/src/binding.js) is mostly done with js's built in ```__lookupSetter__```
* Square's [Crossfilter](http://square.github.io/crossfilter/) - _built for big data_
* NYT's [PourOver](http://nytimes.github.io/pourover/) - _built for big data; has updates+dataflow built in, and a dual functional and procedural interface; no databinds (but we could write a shim to do binding on top..) **the only datastructure involved is Collection (ie a set)** anything requiring a join still needs to be done on the server_
* Miso's [Dataset](http://misoproject.com/dataset/)
* Vega's [Triflow](https://github.com/trifacta/triflow/tree/master/test) - _not actually sure if this is a dataflow library; it seems to too tiny to do anything; maybe it's just clever - nick_
* [AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/databinding) includes databinding as a feature
* [BackboneJS](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Model.JS](https://github.com/curran/model) (new, but written by someone with extensive d3 experience; he even wrote [an intro to AngularJS](http://curran.github.io/screencasts/introToAngular/exampleViewer/#/)
* It might be possible to get away with no learning databinding, but just being wise in application of [d3's native event API](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5872848)
    * [a writeup on this philosophy](http://ag.svbtle.com/on-d3-components)
    * [one of the links from the above](http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/31/extracting-processes/), in Clojure+JS, for another perspective
* [BaconJS](http://baconforme.com/) (clear tutorial [here](http://blog.flowdock.com/2013/01/22/functional-reactive-programming-with-bacon-js/))
* [BreezeJS](http://www.breezejs.com/home), a _LINQ-inspired javascript client_. Perhaps overengineered. Abilities depend on its backends (not unlike what Dataset is to SQLAlchemy is to {MySQL, Postgres, Sqlite, ...}) It is these things:
    * an ORM to SQL
        * recently, [an ORM to MongoDB](http://www.breezejs.com/documentation/mongodb)
    * a query language
    * an intelligent cache
    * helper functions for supporting {Knockout, Angular, ...}'s databinding

We have two related but distinct tasks: 1) query 2) binding. The ideal would be finding (or making) an API that can bind queries:

```
// dream query-binding example
init() {

speedsheetwidget = handsontable(...);
barplot = nvd3.barplot(...);
barplot.title("Farmer Income");

feed = ServerDBProxy.tables.agents.where(time=t, agenttype="farmer").select(backaccount);
bind(spreedsheetwidget, feed);
bind(barplot, feed);
}
```
with zero application-layer code handling the updates
(this will definitely not work with what we have now, but it is inspired by SQLAlchemy and LINQ)
It might turn out that there's no sensible way to write query+binding without writing querybinding. At least, not with the current state of javascript. Or something.

### Databases

A computer system is the union of data and operations on that data. Many programs work fine only with their programming language's native datastructures. The reasons to use a database system--and so the features one usually has--are:

1. persistence: _your data doesn't disappear if your program crashes_ 
   (note that it is possible to do [serialization](#Serialization) without using database software, and for simple cases that may be all you need)
2. faster reads ("queries" in DB parlance):
    1. slicing
    2. aggregation 
3. consistency: _conflict detection and management_ (the [ACID properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID), "transactions" and "rollbacks" in DB parlance)
4. replication: _duplicate your data to multiple places for i. reliability (backups!) ii. availability (every thousand clients can use a different server)_
5. schemas: _reliably structuring your data_
   * it is hotly debated if this is a feature or a bug; in the case of map data, a standard system to read, write, and slice mixed tabular and geometric information is a big win
   * in the case of large amounts of simple data (e.g. almost any social media site) it is unnecessarily restrictive (hence the move towards "NoSQL").
5. revision tracking.

Not every database has 
A database also forces you to think about your datastructures ("schema" in DB parlance), and 

There are many [paradigms](http://www.slideshare.net/slidarko/an-overview-of-data-management-paradigms-relational-document-and-graph-3880059). Every one of these can be mapped into the others; the question of which to use is a mixture of the tradeoffs between what has the most expressive API _for your use case_, what is the most efficient in space, and what is most efficient in time, and what is most efficient in administration.

* Tables: most of these are SQL, but some are not
    * Python APIs: [Overview](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DatabaseInterfaces), [SQL](https://wiki.python.org/moin/DbApiModuleComparison) which conform to [PEP 249](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/), [ORMs &c](https://wiki.python.org/moin/HigherLevelDatabaseProgramming) of which [SQLAlchemy](http://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is head of the pack.
    * [Dee](http://www.quicksort.co.uk/DeeDoc.html) which overloads python operators to create a superset of SQL directly in Python
    * [Dataset](https://dataset.readthedocs.org/) which wraps SQLAlchemy into something ressembling plain dictionaries; somewhat unfinished; working with them would be profitable.
    * Related: [dat](https://github.com/maxogden/dat), a version control (but not query!) system for tabular/object data.
    * [PyTables](http://www.pytables.org/moin) which eschews SQL in favour of hdf5's optimized idea of what a database is (**This isn't SQL.** where does this fit in??
* Maps (_vector maps look a lot like tables, except with a special set of 'geometry' types; raster maps are a different beast_). generally

    * The {Unix, Windows, Mac} File System is a hierarchical key-value store. This really puts it somewhere between a Key-Value Store and a Document Database. With the symlink feature that is standard on *nix (and suitable workarounds for the corner cases) it is also a very functional graph database.
        * [btrfs](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) and [zfs](http://www.open-zfs.org/wiki/Main_Page) are filesystems which have revisions built in; they work very similarly to git, internally.

Tools
* [Jailer](http://jailer.sourceforge.net/), for exporting slices of SQL databases

Remote Query Protocols

* [OData](http://www.odata.org/) - a protocol for exposing (SQL?) RESTfully; seems overengineered.
    * [Query Langauge Spec](http://docs.oasis-open.org/odata/odata/v4.0/os/part2-url-conventions/odata-v4.0-os-part2-url-conventions.html#_Toc372793791) 
* [SparQL](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) - for querying document databases
    * [Example 2](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/j-sparql/) 

Replication

Ideally, we will have some way of watching the db for deltas, turning the deltas into json, and punting them over to the client.

Even better, we would have some way of selecting a subset of data (what SQL and Couch call a [View](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_%28database%29) and only syncing that.
However, this extra feature, supporting arbitrary queries from the front end, means finding or defining a whole query language
that javascript can use, and that's a project unto itself.

Possible approaches:

* SQLite has hooks ([tips](http://sqlite.1065341.n5.nabble.com/Sqlite-replication-td43241.html)):
    * [SQLite Update Hooks](http://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/update_hook.html)
    * [SQLite Virtual Tables](https://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html) could allow us to 'export' SQL to the filesystem; then we could use git or rsync or csync to do replication
        * [Python binding](http://apidoc.apsw.googlecode.com/hg/vtable.html)
        * [Perl binding](http://search.cpan.org/~salva/SQLite-VirtualTable-0.06/lib/SQLite/VirtualTable.pm)
* CouchDB. It is called [replication filtering](http://couchdb.readthedocs.org/en/latest/replication/protocol.html#filter-replication) ([example](http://guide.couchdb.org/draft/notifications.html#filters)) in `feed=continuous` mode)
* Breeze. The components are [projection queries](http://www.breezejs.com/documentation/projection-queries) + [change tracking](http://www.breezejs.com/documentation/change-tracking)
    * A pre-Breeze [example](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj133816.aspx) using MsSQL Server + WCF (C# backend) +{Data,Knockout}JS (HTML5 frontend); it even binds two ways, which is beyond what we care for)
