We own a server at digitalocean. The username is __________ and you can get the password from _______.

## Purposes

* Public relations: Blog and Tutorials (on wordpress or django+mezzanine)
* Developer documentation
* Project-private file store, so that we can legally host our nonfree datasets somewhere that project members can access them (can we set up one of the custom-dropbox implementations like Seafile?)
* Git repos, the same
* irc or jabber chat server (with a web interface! very important!)
* Host our canonical demo simulation
* mailing list with archives

## Issues

Local company Fibernetics has setup [CloudAtCost](http://www.cloudatcost.com/aboutus.php), which is even cheaper than DigitalOcean and evades the privacy and perhaps some amount of the NSA.

Can we get farms.sig.uwaterloo.ca? That would reflect a lot better on us, and make it easier to introduce this project. The school is unlikely to let us point a .uwaterloo.ca address outside of campus, however. Maybe we can beg.

The digitalocean server is running debian-wheezy and has lots of whizbang potential in it, but it desperately needs two people to commit to sysadmining it: handling installs, maintainance, backups, etc.
