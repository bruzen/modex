Statistics
==========

A _statistic_ is some value that can be computed from data (the statisticians distinguish statistics from other sorts of variables, especially model parameters, which cannot be computed from data). This page contains a list of all the sorts of _statistics_ our model explorer will support. This list also includes things which are not traditionally considered statistics, but which nevertheless are computed algorithmically from a dataset.


## Numerical Types

### Summary

* Mean
* Quantiles
    * Median
    * Quartiles 
* Mode(s)
* Variance

### Uncertainty

* {Confidence,Credible} intervals


### Smoothers

There are at least two kinds of smoothing: distribution (1 dimensional) smoothing and function (2 dimensional) smoothing. The basic techniques can be adapted to either purpose.

* Running averages
* Running medians
* Running variances
* Kernel density estimates

## Network Types

* Centrality
    * [all the many variations on centrality]
* (everything [pajek](http://vlado.fmf.uni-lj.si/pub/networks/Pajek/) supports) 


### Timeseries-specific


* [DW Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durbin%E2%80%93Watson_statistic)


## Causal Maps

A causal map takes a large dataset, searches for effects between variables, and outputs a network where nodes are variables and the directed edges are the estimated strength of effect. This is a relatively novel approach **as at team do not understand this, and especially we do not understand the ways it can break, yet, so be careful**.

* R's [dpa](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dpa/) 
* [TETRAD](http://www.phil.cmu.edu/projects/tetrad/) (closed source, but they'll share if we ask nicely)
* [CauseEffect](http://www.causality.inf.ethz.ch/cause-effect.php?page=help) of the Kaggle Contest of the [same name](http://www.kaggle.com/c/cause-effect-pairs)


## Generic dependencies for doing statistics
