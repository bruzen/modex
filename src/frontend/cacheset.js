/* Table: an in-memory in-javascript database system based around multisets instead of around tables or documents (though any can be translated to the others) and around dataflow programming.
 *
 * The system provides subtypes (Where, and, or, not, columns, distinct, sum, average, min, max, groupBy, ...).
 * with each type maintaining a live cache of its current state, as computed from whatever it is based on (necessarily, then, the supported operations are limited to whatever can be efficiently computed on a stream; limited to roughly what SQL provides, in fact).
 
 * The main concept here is the caching, which is a lot like postgres's materialized view; but unlike postgres's implementation, this does edge-triggered processing: it reacts to changes pushed from a source instead of having to poll a source to get a complete new copy.
 *  Since JS is pointers-everywhere, for the types which compute new sets (Where, and, or, not) are storage-cheap: each element only actually exists once; the storage requirement for each type is only sizeof(js_ptr)*cache.length. The other types do not have this guarantee (in particular, Columns has to create new objects)
 *
 *
 * Dependent types listen to their parent's "insert" and "delete" events; when a parent's cache is updated it fires an event, which causes a chain reaction of dependents to check if they should update their cache, and fire their events.
 *
 *
 * Garbage Collection:
 *  - it is important that dependees hold strong references to their parents and that parents hold (at most) weak references to their children
 *  e.g. if you say
 *   var C = new Table([...]);
 *   var large = C.Where(function(e) { e.width > 9 });
 *   var v = large.columns(["name", "type"]).distinct();
 *  then you have must have a chain of strong references
 *    v (a Distinct) -> Columns -> Where -> Table 
 *   which is good and right because v ultimately depends on all of those 
 *  but if you
 *    delete v; (or otherwise lose its reference)
 *  you do not care about either v or the anonymous Columns instance either, and expect them to be garbage collected; however, because they would have registered event listeners with their parents, their parents are holding a pointer to something that eventually leads to them; these pointers must therefore be weak references or else we will leak memory.
 
 * TODO: clean up terminology; decide between parents,children and dependees,dependents
 */ 
 
 
/* Vision for partial server-side querying
 *  if our query ops are compatible with SQL (or at least, if some of them are)
 *  then perhaps we could do something like just quoting the syntax we use to do querying in js and sending that to the server
 *  or do the AST-object idea where we have a parallel tree of RTable objects (R for "Remote")
 *
 * the best would be to have a situation where we can switch between RTable and Table objects just by renaming, and mix and match at will,
 *  easy enough that we can do performance testing--perhaps even hotspot performance testing--to figure out which queries should be server side and which should be client side

// how do I extend the array type?
// do I want to extend the array type?

// Table has an API similar to but only overlapping with--not inheriting--the Array API
// hence, we wrap an array
// Notably, *this type is not actually a set* but rather a multiset since it allows multiple copies of a single item
// (Use Case: cloning SQL db tables; in practice, all SQL rows should have a unique ID, which automatically, but since SQL allows this not to be true I need to support it not being true)


// TODO: support updates; right now, the API forces you to perform updates as a delete foll
// TODO: are there gnarly edge cases where a delete,insert != insert,delete ? perhaps made gnarlier by the identity issues that is() represents?

//var _ = require('../../assets/libs/underscore.js'); //??
//var PourOver = require('../../assets/libs/pourover.js'); 

//module.exports = Table

/* is essentially defines what we consider to be an equal object
 * we could also use underscore's _.isEqual() which does recursive value comparison
 * or == which has some nasty corner cases that === avoids
 */
 // TODO: test identity issues. What happens if we insert three "3"s then remove two of them? What if we do an equivalent test but with objects? what if the objects are literally the same object, and what if they are clones? I use === which performs python's "is" operator but only on two objects; on two primitive types (ints, floats) it does value comparison, and strings seem to exist in the middle: "a" === "a" is true but new String("a") === new String("a") is false ((probably because js does string interning, like python used to do)
// , which might be desirable but also might make problems with double
// ...hm. since my use case plans to eat deletions as json like {-: obj}, obj will *not* be identity-equal with the target
// one solution: switch to _.isEqual(); pro: does what I need; con: slow; potentially unbounded runtime; con: 
// another: design the API--like PourOver--to demand .remove() is given objects from itself (so that we can depend on identity-equals). Then, at the layer that speaks to the WebSocket, do the conversion. This way, the _.isEqual() cruft only has to happen at one layer, and the whole dataflow chain from then on can just use ===
// is-ness matters for: deletes and Distinct
function is(a,b) {
    //return a === b;
    return _.isEqual(a,b); //rational for putting this in here: yes, it slows things down, but it allows .delete() to behave
    // maybe we should write it that .delete() is special cased to use isEqual
}




/* class Table
 *
 * A Table implements a MultiSet of objects. It is intentionally very similar to a SQL table.
 * 
 * API:
 *  - .on("insert", new_row)  -- fired AFTER insertion
 *  - .on("delete", old_row)  -- fired AFTER deletion 
 *  - FUTURE: .on("update", old_row, new_row) -- fired AFTER updating
 *  - .on("rerender")         -- fired AFTER inserts, updates, deletes
 *  - FUTURE: .at, .toArray(), etc(??)
 *  - CURRENT: use ._cache to access the current state
 *  - Operators:
 *      S.and(Q), S.or(Q)
 *        or And(S, Q, ...), Or(S, Q, ...)
 *      S.where(pred)  - filter the set by a predicate
 *      S.distinct()   - choose only unique items, as compared by underscore's _.isEqqual()
 *      S.map(f)       - convert elements to a new element via a map function
 *      S.select(fields) - slice out new objects from 
 *      S.scalar(field)  - choose only the given field
 *
 *      FUTURE: S.reduce((prev, insert) -> next, (prev, ) - compact the table into a single value
              using this reduce is a bit unusual compared to the classic reduce, because you "prev" value needs to be as much data as you need to handle both inserts and deletes; for 'sum' prev is simply the value of the sum (since a delete can be applied with subtraction), but for more complica
 *      FUTURE: S.sum()         - only works on tables of numbers; will throw an exception if it hits
 
 *  - FUTURE: Join(S, Q, fields)
 * 
 * roughly three categories: filters (and, or, not, where, distinct), maps (map, select, scalar), reduces (sum, avg, 
 *
 * TODO: pick a more descriptive and accurate name
 * TODO: implement .length
 * TODO: implement iterators or element access or something (rather than telling clients to just use ._cache); or, subclass Array and use its built in indexers
