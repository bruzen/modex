# Frontend Developer's Readme


## Developer's Tools

Since web browsers have a wide attack surface they have many many security restrictions. The [same-origin policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript) is one major limitation that needs to be respected.
Browsers are even more restrictive when running locally: that is, when the URL starts with "file://" instead of "http://", more rules kick in;
 one of these rules, the ()[] rule, blocks canvas elements from working.
Thus in order to do any debugging you _must_ launch a development http server.

 In the long run, we will eventually have to support running on 'heavy' servers like
 Apache, nginx, or lighttpd,
 but in the meantime
There's [Twisted's server](http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/wiki/TwistedWeb),
 [Ruby on Rails' server](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/webrick/rdoc/index.html),
 [django's server](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/django-admin/#runserver-port-or-address-port).
On linux, [thttpd]() and [webfs](http://linux.bytesex.org/misc/webfs.html) are very viable options ("cd frontend; webfsd -d . & firefox localhost:8000" will get you up and hacking)
or you could consider [Spawning](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Spawning), [Gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/), [Cherokee](http://cherokee-project.com/)
((**TODO**: pick a server, write batch files to start it on each of the three OSes.))

It behooves you to have a web developer console open. Chrome and Firefox have built-in inspectors accessible with ctrl-shift-i,
Firefox has the option of installing the Firebug extension which is
 a) older b) better than the built in inspector.

For certain in-depth debugging scenarios like tracking the flow of call-response with all the headers and contents
you might need to investigate [Fiddler](http://fiddler2.com/) which

## Compatibility

Since this is a web app, it needs to be tested in all browsers on all platforms.
Since that's not a realistic goal, especially not at this stage and with this size of team,
we should at least cover:
Firefox on Windows, Mac, and Linux
Chrome on Windows, Mac, and Linux
