   // WebSockets, despite essentially being TCP--a stream protocol--

   // is line-oriented--a sort of packetization again!--

// Now that we can get changes out of postgres and into the web, we need somewhere to put them so that they can be rendered and interacted with.
// There are many ways to cache and query data in Javascript.
//  Using plain arrays containing objects (aka dictionaries) and writing manual scans is the oldest and probably most common;
//  Indeed, this is what the d3.csv() function provides and what, it seems, d3 expects.
//  There's a series of APIs, none ever yet fully implemented, for providing permanent storage for web pages; see http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html
//  - DOM Storage
//  - LocalStorage
//  - WebSQL
//  - IndexedDB
// IndexedDB seems to be winning, and it's what PouchDB--which is an implementation of CouchDB right in javascript, adding foreign keys, replication and versioning--prefers to back itself with.
//   
// There are at least two libraries which do not spec storage but instead focus on queries:
//List all the in-JS DB options:
//  - crossfilter
//  - PourOver
// both of these do not provide Views.
//  PourOver is promising, but needs enhancements before it is usable for us.
//  It's initial design was to avoid doing round-trips--making the server a bottleneck to all the web clients--just to perform queries
// For example,
//   PourOver has something it calls a View, but they are not arranged to easily make multiples (the default implementation shares the same query--which it takes as the intersection of all defined filters--amongst all instances)
//   Also, PourOver's filters are like parameterized where statements, however they are quirky. makeExactFilter(dimension, [options]) demands that the possible options must be explicitly given. PourOver provides no way to make a filter corresponding to "select where dimension = $1" and no way to do "select unique(dimension)" which would at least make dealing with not knowing the options alright.
//   PourOver must be really good where you have a known data model and you just want to send lots of data and make it interactive.


// Whichever we go with, we should be watchful of the query patterns we use,
//  because--at least to some degree (be mindful of PourOver's point that hitting the server on every query is wasteful!)--
// The best in the long term would be to be able to treat the javascript database as a memoization cache; with items stored when asked for, with old items being evicted.
