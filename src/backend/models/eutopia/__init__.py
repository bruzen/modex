# eutopia.py is king in this module
# so we export everything that eutopia.py exports
from eutopia import *

# but the real power lies in the queen: simulation.py.
# Currently it is a member of this module, but Simulation
# should be pulled out of this module once it (and Eutopia 
# (and server.py)) is generic enough.
