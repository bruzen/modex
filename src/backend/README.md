# Backend Developer's Guide

First review the [generic developer's guide](../README.md).

As a backend developer, it is worthwhile to learn how to run the server directly.
While you can develop portions of it under a simple ```run.py```,
running it directly removes the source of potential bugs from that one layer of indirection
 and lets you tweak command line arguments. To run the server directly, use:
```bash
$ python src/backend/server.py
```

It doesn't matter what folder you run the server from (_if it does seem to matter, file a bug report_)
```bash
$ cd src/backend
$ python server.py
```

If you add 'debug' as an argument to the server you will see the web logs:
```bash
$ cd src/backend
$ python server.py debug

## WebSocket Notes

We're using [autobahn](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython) as our backend implementation of the websocket protocol (it's a protocol that rides on top of HTTP, just to make the web stack even deeper).
WebSockets provide a (**TODO**: summarize and/or link why websockets) more efficient protocol--less bandwidth and much better latency--than typical request-response HTTP. We are using them because we expect (though we don't actually have any).

In Twisted, a "protocol" is a class which knows how to send and receive data in some particular way,
 and gets instantiated anew **for each connection**(!).
 To hook up a "protocol" to a server, you must wrap the protocol in a "ServerFactory" and pass that as a node to the actual server (this is already done and shouldn't have to be tweaked too much).
The tricky part of this for development is that since each 'protocol' happens new for each connection from each client,
you should not build any statefulness into your "protocols" even though they feel in some ways like the heart of the server. You need to make a tertiary class . Think of protocols as _views_ on your _model_ (and the twisted server which holds the listening TCP connections as the _controller_).
 You _can_ remember the position of your database cursor or your file's seek position within a single "protocol", but anything, updating the database needs to be external (and make the assumption that the connection can die at piece).
However, Twisted thought ahead and covered this situation: every instance of a protocol gains, as .factory, the Factory which created it; so any shared state can (and in most of the [examples](http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/current/core/examples/), is) shared there.

* [Server-side WebSocket API reference](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/doc)
* [Browser-side WebSocket API reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket).

WebSockets, like the _webservice_ protocols that came before them, are referenced like any other HTTP or object: with a URL.
A websocket URL looks like "ws://server:port/path/to/endpoint" or "wss://server:port/path/to/endpoint", the difference being that the latter causes the websocket to connect over SSL.

Autobahn is functional, but it's [website](http://autobahn.ws/python/tutorials/echo/) is currently (**TODO**: update this when this changes) out of date. The github docs and examples seem to be reasonably up to date (they have test cases and stuff, so they better be) so for now, use that as your reference.

Here's some guidance on debugging websockets. Debugging them means tweaking things in ```server.py``` and then opening up
a javascript console from a browser. These notes are in this **README** and not **[[../frontend/README.md]]** since this is really more of an issue--but both sides can and should refer and add to these notes.

When you're in the browser console, you can make a websocket to test with by:
```
   ws = new WebSocket("ws://server:9000/endpoint");
```
   If you drop the ```new``, it'll still work. The difference [is](http://trephine.org/t/index.php?title=Understanding_the_JavaScript_new_keyword) and [occasionally non-existent](

Using 'wss' is a good idea, but unless you've got SSL set up on the server it'll hang and you won't know why because neither the browser API nor Autobahn explicitly mention "SSL" when such a connection fails.

The hostname MUST be the same as the site you are on due to the same-origin policy (unless you do some server side black magic which we shall avoid)
 * In particular, when debugging, you should first open up the server in your webbrowser (autobahn gives a useful response if you hit it with http:// instead of ws://, so if your websocket is supposed to be ws://localhost:9242/ws, then first open http://localhost:9242/ws before trying to debug stuff)

This one-liner lets you test if a websocket is listening:
 ```
  s = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:8080"); s.onmessage = function(d) { console.log("recv: " + d.data); }; setTimeout(function() { s.send("butts")},1000);
```
  (the setTimeout is because the websocket needs a moment to wake up and handshake; better would be 'onopen'... but with this method you get an error instead of a silent an inexplicable hang)

## Gotchas




You must run the server under python2. Twisted is [the largest](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) library yet to be ported to python3.

In twisted, node.putChild() must have its first argument **NOT** end with a '/'. That will cause mysterious 404s with no clue in the log.

In OL3, when loading Vector layers, you (for some currently unknown reason) must pass 'renderer: ol.RendererHint.CANVAS' to the Map constructor or else they will fail with a nil ptr exception in the bowels of OL.


## Compatibility

we should at least cover:
Installing the server on
* Ubuntu
* Mac
