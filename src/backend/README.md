# Backend Developer's Guide

First review the [generic developer's guide](../README.md).

As a backend developer, it is worthwhile to learn how to run the server directly.
While you can develop portions of it under a simple ```run.py```,
running it directly removes the source of potential bugs from that one layer of indirection
 and lets you tweak command line arguments. To run the server directly, use:
```bash
$ python src/backend/server.py
```

It doesn't matter what folder you run the server from (_if it does seem to matter, file a bug report_)
```bash
$ cd src/backend
$ python server.py
```

If you add 'debug' as an argument to the server you will see the web logs:
```bash
$ cd src/backend
$ python server.py debug

## Gotchas




You must run the server under python2. Twisted is [the largest](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) library yet to be ported to python3.

In twisted, node.putChild() must have its first argument **NOT** end with a '/'. That will cause mysterious 404s with no clue in the log.

In OL3, when loading Vector layers, you (for some currently unknown reason) must pass 'renderer: ol.RendererHint.CANVAS' to the Map constructor or else they will fail with a nil ptr exception in the bowels of OL.


## Compatibility

we should at least cover:
Installing the server on
* Ubuntu
* Mac
