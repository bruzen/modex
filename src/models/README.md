This folder includes a number of simulations developed or used by our research group.

If Modex is successful, it will _usefully_ wrap all of these, even though they are diverse.

## Rough Taxonomy of Models

* Trivial: models with no meat to them, just to provide a baseline for input-output
  * beta.py
  * mlm.R
* Simple: for dynamics models, they should have less than 5 rules per step
  * EvilBankerSim
  * Dating (version 1) 
  * lightbulb
* Medium
  * Dating (version 2)
  * FarmSimulationModel (version 1)
* Large: models including a significant number of [lalala]
  * RegMAS
  * SLUCE
* Huge
  * farmsim (final modex version)
