## Model Parameters:

GENDER_DISTANCE = 10; # the distance between the means of the gender distributions;
                     #  the gender curves are spaced evenly around 0
                     # see Person for details
FEMALE_SD = 3;       # by default, Females have a wider gender-identity variance than males
MALE_SD   = 1;

# TODO: allow plotting of the expected gender densities from the paramters
#   -- maybe this isn't so important; if modex works, then it should be able to extract them from the data

# TODO: allow characteristics to shift over time, so that dynamics happen

## Model:

import math, random

def sigmoid(x):
    "the logistic function; good for mapping R to (0,1)"
    return 1 / (1 + math.exp(-x))

    "given x on (-Inf,+Inf), compress it to (-1,1)"
    return sigmoid(x)*2 - 1

    """
    In this version of the model, a person has three characteristics:
      * hotness -- a single (positive) score representing the aggregate of all their positive and negative traits ((obvious flaw in this model: what is attractive to one person is sometimes--often--repulsive to another))
         actually, this is 1 to 10, giving the bro-scale
      * gender  -- a score on -1 to 1 giving the gender-identity (male: -1, 0: androgynous, female: 1) ((objection: Morgan_Holmes would object to this definition))
         In this model, gender is by default generated from a mixture-normal distribution, mixed on sex, with sex chosen with even probability.
         The pure-females distribution has a wider variance than males ((objection: some scholars think gender is independent of sex; this is an open question))
      * orientation -- a score on the same scale as gender giving how attracted
         e.g. a Person with a very male orientation will score highest on Persons who have a high male gender, lowest on those with a high female gender
              a Person with a 0 orientation ignores gender in scoring another Person
         given a chosen sex, orientation is again a smooth bi-modal distribution:
              most people are attracted to the opposite gender with a smaller hump attracted to their own
              first we choose a major orientation, with most people are taken to be attracted to the opposite gender (93%)
              and then we impose a X^2_2 distribution on their actual orientation from there
              (which is actually simpler: first, pick a X^2_2, then align it so that the peak is on the female end if Person's major orientation is to females, and to males otherwise)

         since sex is symmetric, the total orientation distribution should also be bimodal
