# activity.py
"""
This defines the sorts of economic actions that a farmer can perform.
Currently, all activities are planting choices performed upon a particular Farm polygon.

Each activity has a name, requires some equipment, and has some costs and products.
Currently, costs are rolled in as negative products.
Some of the "products" are actually "measures": the effect of the activity on
some global variable, like GDP or carbon. (Activity.get_product handles the two cases).

TODO:
* [ ] think about fixed costs and non-linear (economies of scale)
* [ ] include equipment
* [ ] Write a Product class; make sure it's hashable so it can be used as dictionary keys.
