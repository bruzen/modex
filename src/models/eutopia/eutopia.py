## Model Overview
#
#
# state:
#  Farms - a set of georeferenced polygons containing (id, soil_type, county, activity, {some other stuff that we ignore})
#        MAP_CODE is the type of farming done on that land (which might not strictly be farming. Activities like lying fallow or running a jungle gym are possible) 
#  FarmFamily - an agent which has (bank_account, preferences)
#  
#  
# interventions:
# Upon the substrate of model state, Eutopia gives the user the power to
# manipulate things like tax rates, new farming (or otherwise) activities, new equipment
# We call these "interventions" and they operate by
# (TODO: this part hasn't actually been properly spec'd yet; there are arguments to have)
# 
# logged state:
#  - every Farm's (activity, soil status, ...?)
#  - every FarmFamily (bank account, farms <-- requires a separate table...)
#  - the current value of aggregate_measures (TODO: doing this cleanly requires cleaning up Activity first and dealing with the Normal()s in there which are in the wrong place)
#  - activity counts
#
# future plans:
# Farms will grow SOIL_TYPE
# A Farmer class, which is born into a FarmFamily, moves, perhaps inherits farms from their parents, dies
#
