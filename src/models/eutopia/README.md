Possible worlds farm simulation

You should see a symlink (if you're on OS X or Linux; dunno about Windows)
```Elora_esque.shp.zip -> Elora_esque.shp.zip.real``` here.
The ".real" file is copyrighted and you need to obtain it from a team member.
Once you have it, you should be able to just put it in this folder.
See src/README.md for the reasoning behind this design.
