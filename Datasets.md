(Nick organized a starting list based on a brainstorm we did together.)

## Potential Datasets

### Scrapbucket
* [UK](http://data.gov.uk/)
* [USA](http://www.data.gov/) (_incidentally, they make verrry good use of OpenLayers in their [dataset pages](http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/gender-persons-by-sex-sds-2000/resource/9a87571f-e945-4ff4-971a-607530d19358)_)
* [Canada](http://data.gc.ca)
* http://datamarket.com
* datahub.io


we should just scrape http://www.agr.gc.ca/atlas/data_donnees/ (sketchy redhat server ftw)

## GIS ##
Datasets are available from [http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/](Scholar's GeoPortal) which are available to the current
team members--all members of one of the 21 universities in Ontario Council of Unversity Libraries--under the [http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/tou.html](GeoPortal TOU)
There is a lot of data here, and they are freely available for any sort of research use (basically, anything that
would count as fair use and then some), but absolutely banned from commericial exploitation. Also, there is a fiat
ban on redistribution of these datasets from ScholarsPortal--we would need to collect permission from the original
copyright holders, which several files have several of.

Without a lawyer and perhaps a day in court, it is unclear whether making a game backed by GIS data counts as "redistribution".

The dataset Nick originally found, the Agriculture Resource Inventory (ARI) 2012,
 was from [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/](OMAFRA) judging from its metadata file
 (**can someone doublecheck this for me?**).

Additionally, there is also the Ontario Geospatial Data Exchange, which organizes GIS datasharing between agencies like OMAFRA
and which maintains a [https://www.appliometadata.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home](different datastore) which explicitly
has 91 Open Data sets, licensed by a 3-clause-BSD style [http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-government-licence-ontario](Open Government License).
That's probably a better choice, especially since there are inconsistencies between the ARI and the OGDE datastore,
like how the first lists only two abattoirs whereas the has an entire
[https://www.appliometadata.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=7351&currTab=distribution](meat plants) dataset.

TODO: ROAD NETWORK
Terminology: "cadastral"

## Data Types

One of our todos, issue #22, is 

### Maps - Raster
(**NB**: rasters can be coerced with some resolution loss to vectors, so this list is only tentative)

1. (Human) Wealth density
1. Ground water
1. Surface water
1. Heightmap
1. Population density (human, rabbit, fox, deer, butterfly, forest, dandelion
1. Albedo
1. Climate?? Temperature? Wetness?? unsure
1. Soil type (are there subproperties here? like separate layers for nitrogen, oxygen, water..?)
1. Location and type/quality of forests
1. Population location and density
1. Location of watersheds/rivers

  
### Maps - Vector
(**NB**: vectors can be coerced with some resolution loss to rasters, so this list is only tentative)

1. Agent locations
1. Major food warehouses (e.g. Food Terminal in Toronto - I think most of Ontario's food goes there)
1. Roads, Highways, Rail, Shipping Routes, Ports, Backroads
1. Watersheds
1. Rivers / groundwater / lakes
1. Underground water: aquifers
1. Political Boundaries:
  * country
  * provincial
  * regional
  * municipal
1. Greenbelt / Bioregion boundaries, Food Safety Inspection Zones)

### Network
1.  Seller networks (directed)
1.  Social networks (undirected)
1.  Resource flow Networks
  - Food: directed
  - Money: bidirected
  - Manufacturing ((there's an open problem here: what does it mean to track resources as they transform? how do we visualize that?))
 
### Tabular
1. What food processing is done 
1. Farm level crop production (broadly by category)
1. Quantity of food for (Ontario/rest of Canada)
1. Properties of species

### Tabular: [Resource/Product I/O Rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input-output_model)
* Farming methods
* Farm productiveness by land-type

### Time Series
1.  GDP / Overall / Average Wealth
1. Health metrics
1. Carbon
1. ??????
1. Standardized educational testing scores

### Casuality
1. How land/light/warmth etc modifies production of goods by farms
1. How roads/people/land/light/warmth etc modifies survival of species
1. Input/output table of production techniques

### To Sort
Weather?? (Light, Wetness)
  --this is tricky.


# Mockup
For getting the ball rolling, let us invent datasets and put them under assets/data/, in .csv, .dot, and .shp formats.

1) Table of Agents
 - farmers
 - processing plants?
 - buyers (cities)
2) Map (Vector layer--possibly just a sketch in photoshop) of Agents
3) Road Network
4) Raster: Wealth Distribution for each of 6 time steps
5) Raster: Water distibution for each of 6 time steps
Raster: land cover type? (or should this be split into soil type/water/...?)

6) Raster: Forest distribution for each of 6 time steps

Raster: Habitat for each of 3 species

Timeseries (for 6 time steps): GDP

Timeseries (for 6 time steps): Carbon

I would really like to include weather in here, but weather is neither raster, vector, nor time series. It's several interacting vector fields as functions of time--which we could think of as a raster, and that is what the radar maps show, but I am unsure of the best practice here
