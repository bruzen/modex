# Media Goals

CorridorDesign [says](http://corridordesign.org/)
> Our goal is to

and we couldn't say it better ourselves

To that end, we need easy to read guides that get the interested lay public (which, frankly, excepting a person's particular field, is everyone). Can we get technical brochures and videos done up by a graphic designer with infovis experience? How do we tutor people from afar?

  * "The Science of Simulation"
    * timestepping vs continuous time, uncertainty vs confidence bands, chaos
  * "Modern Cartography"
    * raster
    * vector: polygon, point, line
    * DEM
    * 
 
**TODO**: link Majd's NFB-experienced friend here

# Reproducible Science

(this maybe deserves a page of its own)
_Open-access_ and _reproducible science_ are getting a lot of buzz these days, and we think that the promise of the internet and the free flow of information for reinvigorating academia is golden. We want to get all over that. [tbekolay](https://github.com/tbekolay/scipy2013-workflow) of [tcstewar](FIXME)'s research group advocates posting code and papers along with Makefiles (or equivalent), so that any interested party can immediately download, test and build on your work. There are [other](FIXME) [proposals](FIXME) which point out that github perhaps isn't the best for science, since it isn't great at managing datasets or citations, but something _like_, supporting the principle of letting anyone from around the world poke at our work as it develops, will guide us.
