# Changelog and Research Notes #

## GIS ##
Datasets are available from [http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/](Scholar's GeoPortal) which are available to the current
team members--all members of one of the 21 universities in Ontario Council of Unversity Libr;5C;5Caries--under the [http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/tou.html](GeoPortal TOU)
There is a lot of data here, and they are freely available for any sort of research use (basically, anything that
would count as fair use and then some), but absolutely banned from commericial exploitation. Also, there is a fiat
ban on redistribution of these datasets from ScholarsPortal--we would need to collect permission from the original
copyright holders, which several files have several of.

Without a lawyer and perhaps a day in court, it is unclear whether making a game backed by GIS data counts as "redistribution".
