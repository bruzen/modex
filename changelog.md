Datasets are available from [http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/](Scholar's GeoPortal) which are available to the current
team members--all members of one of the 21 universities in Ontario Council of Unversity Libraries--under the [http://geo2.scholarsportal.info/tou.html](GeoPortal TOU)
There is a lot of data here, and they are freely available for any sort of research use (basically, anything that
would count as fair use and then some), but absolutely banned from commericial exploitation. Also, there is a fiat
ban on redistribution of these datasets from ScholarsPortal--we would need to collect permission from the original
copyright holders, which several files have several of.

Without a lawyer and perhaps a day in court, it is unclear whether making a game backed by GIS data counts as "redistribution".

The dataset Nick originally found, the Agriculture Resource Inventory (ARI) 2012,
 was from [http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/](OMAFRA) judging from its metadata file
 (**can someone doublecheck this for me?**).

Additionally, there is also the Ontario Geospatial Data Exchange, which organizes GIS datasharing between agencies like OMAFRA
and which maintains a [https://www.appliometadata.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/main.home](different datastore) which explicitly
has 91 Open Data sets, licensed by a 3-clause-BSD style [http://www.ontario.ca/government/open-government-licence-ontario](Open Government License).
That's probably a better choice, especially since there are inconsistencies between the ARI and the OGDE datastore,
like how the first lists only two abattoirs whereas the has an entire
[https://www.appliometadata.lrc.gov.on.ca/geonetwork/srv/en/metadata.show?id=7351&currTab=distribution](meat plants) dataset.
