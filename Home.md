This is a project of the [sig.uwaterloo.ca](Social Innovation Group) at the Univeristy of Waterloo. We are building a simulation of agriculture in southern ontario which we will then be able to fork, edit, and play with to invent and investigate hypotheses. Our perspective is holistic: we see agriculture as simultaneously economic, ecological, cultural and as involving both urban humans, rural humans, and animal life.
