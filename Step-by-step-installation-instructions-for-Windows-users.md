1. Download [Github](http://windows.github.com) from 
2. Open GITHUB and sign in
3. Navigate to [https://github.com/majdal/modex](https://github.com/majdal/modex) and click "Clone in Desktop"
4. Download and install “Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition with SP1”
from: [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2008-editions/express) and  [here](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=13276)
5. Download and install Python 2.x.y from:
http://www.python.org/download/ Choose “Windows Installer” (32bit
version) not “Windows X86-64 Installer”
6. Download and install pywin32 from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/
--Click on “pywin32” folder
--Click on the first folder (in this case, Build 217, maybe newer when you try)
--Choose the file ending with ”.win32-py2.x.exe” -> x being the minor
version of Python you installed (in this case, 7) When writing this
guide, the file was:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20217/pywin32-217.win32-py2.7.exe/download

7. Open GITHUB Shell from the start menu
8. Type [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path",
"$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\", "User")
9. This didn't work for me (maybe because of administrator issues) so
I had to goto Control Panel>search for 'Edit the system environment
variables'. Once System Properties is open, click on Environment
Variables>'New' under System Variables and add
Variable Name: Path
Variable Value: $env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\

10. Download these two files:
https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
11. Open GITHUB Shell
12. Navigate to where you downloaded the files from Step 10 and run them:
First, "python ez_setup.py"
Then. "python get-pip.py"

13. Close and open GITHUB Shell
14. Navigate to the modex folder (Most likely in your Documents folder
under GITHUB)
15. Type "pip install twisted" and press Enter
16. Type "pip install -r requirements.txt" and press Enter
17. Type "python run.py" and press Enter
18. Hopefully, this will open a new browser window pointing to
http://127.0.0.1:8080.
