 this API ONLY supports positional arguments; AutobahnWamp tries to support keyword arguments, but depending on your perspective
  either js already has keyword args (just pass an object (aka a dict)) or it has no keyword args
  so we'll just ride on that..

/* backend (API #2):
 I like API 2 because it exposes each method as a distinct URL which feels more RESTish to me
  and it eschews sending metadata over the wire, because the socket you're connecting to 
 I don't like the proliferation of objects internally which do basically nothing but placemarkers for that metadata
  
  the really nice thing about this is that you can

    "handles serialization automatically"
    "and nothing else"

    def onMessage(self, payload, isBinary):
        # XXX maybe _target() should be called on a Deferred? we have no idea
        # how long _target() will take to execute, and hanging the whollle server
        # ..but maybe that's part of the game; hanging the server early
        # in test is better than load problems sneaking up later because
        # the app writer didn't thoroughly make sure they had caching in at the right layers
        
        # note: protocol assumes only one message at a time
        #  if we didn't, messages would need to come with an id code (like Autobahn does)
        # ...actually that's not true, these four lines enforce one-message-at-a-time:

and similarly for the frontend, we need a bit of magic to get things rolling
(sadly, js has no __getattr__ magic, so we'll need to explicitly define the methods)

function RPC(ws, methods) {
    queue = []
	methods.each(
	 this[m]._ws = new WebSocket(ws+"/"+m); //XXX should be URLjoin
	 this[m]._ws.onmessage = function(evt) {
	    if(queue.length <= 0) {
	    	throw new Error("Received RPC message but no call is in the queue waiting for it");
	    }
	 	response = serializer.parse(evt.data);
	 	if('error' in response) {
	 		console.error("RPC call to", ws, "failed:", response.error);
	 	} else if('payload' in response) {
	 		queue[0].resolve(response.payload);
	 	}
	 	queue.shift(); //this message is resolved.
	 	
	 	//we still want a queue here....
	 	# resolve the promise at the top of the queue
	 	# if we get a message it's an error (but we have nowhere to put the error, so i guess silently ignore it)
	 	// TODO: experiment with setTimeout(function() { }, 10) //
	 	
	 }
	  this[m] = function() {
	    arguments = Array.prototype.slice(arguments);
	  	this[m].send(JSON.stringify(arguments));
	  	return new Promise()
	  }
	}
}

// usage:
tank = RPC("ws://example.com/tank2", ["hp", "turn", "shoot"]) //you really shouldn't be holding any local state in tank yourself; if you insist, you can attach it after; but better to wrap, like function Tank() {... this._remote_tank = RPC(...) }
tank.hp().then(function(...) {...})
