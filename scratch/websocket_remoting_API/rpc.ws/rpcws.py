"""
RPC.ws: python server code

This on AutobahnPython on Twisted.

Provides one class:
 - RPCProtocol, which wraps a callable into something that speaks websockets+json

And two convenience functions, which make Twisted Resource objects:
 - RPCEndpoint - which turns an RPCProtocol into something usable
 - RPCObjectEndpoint - which wraps all public methods on an object into RPCEndpoints

TODO:
 * [ ] figure out a sane way for users to change the serializer
 * [ ]
 * [ ] An DetailedRPCProtocol (and associated DetailsRPC(Object)?Endpoint calls) which is meant to cooperate with target by passing itself in so that target can do something;
     ---> or
   * [ ] or maybe a better idea is to attach the RPCProtocol object to _target, and if _target happens to be a callable class (but this
 * [ ] To simplify a common case, an AuthRPCProtocol which takes two args: an auth_manager and a target, and behaves the same as RPCProtocol except that before calling target() it checks with auth_mananger first
   ^ anyway, the problem of the leaky abstraction is going to require some cleverness to solve elegantly, but I'm sure we can get there when we need it.
