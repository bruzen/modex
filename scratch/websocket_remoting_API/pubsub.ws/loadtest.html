<h1>WebSocket Load Test</h1>
<p>Using the simplified pubsub backend, this test creates many WebSockets simultaneously to see how browsers behave.</p>
<p>To see this, run</p>
<code>loadtest.py 10</code>
<p>You can change that 10 to other numbers, and try changing the <code>n = </code> in this own file to match (or to not match).</p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every Websocket is one TCP connection. No multiplexing is going on, natively</li>
<li>Despite that, WebSockets don't have the standard 6/2 rule of HTTP connections apply to them:
  Getting 10 connections at once seems stable, </li>
  Running 50 sockets maxed out at 4 clients, but this seems to be a firefox bug
  because splitting 20 sockets per client across 4 firefox windows and 3 chrome windows worked just fine
  (I actually managed to get it up to 20 windows across 5 browsers; chrome hung on and off and probably firefox too but it was quieter about it)
<li>it is possible to crash Firefox or hang its js interpreter in mysterious ways, even across page reloads, by opening too many WebSockets</li>
</ul>
