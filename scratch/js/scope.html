//one way to get things into global scope, if you really want to do that, is to declare them there
//but in js 


// this function is run in 'window's scope, so any variables declared in it without using 'var' are attached to window, which is what the js console considers to be global

hax = function() {

var a = 1;  
b = a + a;

//how is scope?
//is it that once a var is defined, assigning to it keeps its scope the same?
//or is it like python, where assigning is auto-local?

var c = b+b+"c"
d = "totally new"
}



// in global scope
// see what we did
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("a=",a) //'a', because in the onload we used 'var' which made a local
  console.log("b=",b) //2, because we didn't declare b 'var'
  console.log("d=",d); //just to drive home the point
  console.log("c=",c); //ReferenceError: c is not defined
}, 3000)


//it doesn't seem to matter whether we use jquery or the native method
//hax() always gets run in global scope
//window.onload = hax
//$(document).ready(hax)
