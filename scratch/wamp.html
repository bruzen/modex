<p>I'm concerned that WAMP is wasteful. It seems ..sort of silly.
 It screams overengineered to me. It's entirely possible I'm just being picky.

 Do we ~need~ it? It seems simpler to run a separate WebSocket endpoint for each feed
  (we might have scaling issues with that)
 I suppose Autobahn transparently handles multiple subscribers to the same stream, and that ~is~ a difficult feature that we need
  
 The flash of the website combined with how out of date it is is give me jiggies.
