sqldiff algorithm


inputs: two tables with the same columns, fully sorted
{nb: fully sorted means first sorted on the first column, then by the second to break ties, then by the third.. all the way down to the end; sql's ORDER BY clause performs this for us}
(other nb: the particular sort uses doesn't matter, so long as it is consistent from run to run)

Call the first table L and the second N

start rolling down the tables, searching for identical rows.
Because of the sort, we know that [....] 
 e.g. if the left says [a, 4, q] and the right says [a, 6, g] 
  then you know to advance the left pointer


output: whatever remains in L is the "deletes" list and what is in N is "adds"

# one sort of test: construct a list of additions and deletions and updates
# apply them
# then run diff on the results
# and compare the result of diffs

# cases to check for:
#  - a typical case
#  - duplicate rows should be considered distinct!!
#  - what happens if one of the earlier columns is updated; is it detected as an update?
#  - what happens if a mixture of the 
#  - what happens if only one column is updated
#  - having lists of overlap [a, ...], [a, ....]
#  - an empty left (---> ejntirely adds)
#  - an empty right (---> entirely deletes)
#  -

# these next two tests are not very interesting if we just have
#  additions/deletions, but are very interesting if there's updates
# will the algorithm detect updates to early columns?
