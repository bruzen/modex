"""
Implements a publish-subscribe (PubSub) broker over WebSockets.

Each subscribable "topic" is just a URL. Messages are "published" by sending websocket messages,
and are relayed, unfiltered, to every other websocket open to the same endpoint. The server can publish messages by calling

If you need filtering or anything else fancier, subclass this.

Since we're using WebSockets in Python, we're using Autobahn on Twisted, so make sure those are installed
