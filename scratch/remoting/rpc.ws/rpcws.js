/* ideal API:
 *   tank = RPC("ws://example.com/games/0xG56/sprites/tank65")
 *   tank.turn(47.9); //-> cast to
 *   tank.HP().then(function(h) { console.log("I have", h.current, "hit points of", h.total) })
 
 * other ideal API (but expensive unless we multiplex websockets)
 *  tank_turn = RPC("ws://example.com/games/0xG56/sprites/tank65/hp/turn")
 *  tank_turn(47.9).error(function(e) { console.log("Error while turning tank:", e); })
 *  tank_HP = RPC("ws://example.com/games/0xG56/sprites/tank65/hp")

// protocol 1:
// first, connect to the websocket supporting this protocol 
// calls: {'method': methodname, 'arguments': [arg1, arg2, ...]} in json
// responses: {'error': 'error message'} || {'payload': return_value}

// protocol 2 (aka your mother's simplest protocol):
// 
// calls: [arg1, arg2, ...] in json
// responses: {'error': 'error message'} || {'result': return_value} in json
// protocol 2a (to support object mapping)
//  -> no change to the basic protocol
//  -> objects get unique URLs ("//example.com/data/maps/vector/buildings/northyork") which simply give a "This is a WebSocket Object Endpoint" page when accessed over HTTP
//  -> their methods are under them in the hierarchy (say, internally, northyork has northyork.m1(), northyork.m2(), then )
// "ws://example.com/data/maps/vector/buildings/northyork/m1" and "ws://example.com/data/maps/vector/buildings/northyork/m2" are URLs supporting protocol 2

Either API ONLY
 a) supports positional arguments
  AutobahnWamp tries to support keyword arguments, but depending on your perspective
  either js already has keyword args (just pass an object (aka a dict)) or it has no keyword args
  so we'll just ride on that..
 b) handles calls strictly in order (so a slow call will hold up a fast one if it happened to be invoked first); if you need non-strict RPC ordering, design your system with two RPC websockets: a fast and a slow one);
 AutobahnWamp supports non-strict ordering, and it does this by generating (in-browser) a (hopefully, but you know how that goes) crypto-strong message ID hash, and sending it with each message, which forces each message to be a meta-structure (ie. {'method': method, 'id': id, parameters: [real arguments go here]}) 


  I like API 1 because it makes the number of necessary websockets less (but we were already planning on using a Multiplexer)
   and it seems like it should make the internal implementation shorter: there's only one (WebSocketResource, WebSocketServerFactory, WebSocketServerProtocol) instead of one of those triplets for EACH method
   and it makes more sense, then, to pass in the data from the WebSocketServerProtocol (like .peer, .connected, .time, .http_headers)
   --and it allows you to call methods not specified -- but maybe that's a bug, not a feature, in the context of RPC
    I would like API 1 more if js supported autopassing not-found attrs to something like __getattr__ in python/ruby;
      -> because you can't do this, AutobahnWamp insists you do session.call("methodname", args)

  
  I like API 2 because it exposes each method as a distinct URL which feels more RESTish to me;
   it will certainly be easier to debug and log, long term, because we can eg. use Wireshark filtering on HTTP URLs instead of having to filter
  and it eschews sending metadata over the wire, because the socket you're connecting to IS the metadata
    I don't like the proliferation of objects internally which do basically nothing but placemarkers for that metadata -- but that probably doesn't actually hurt the performance
   I also very much like that API doesn't -force- you to be OOP: in API2 the default case is an exposed function call, and it's only by extension (Protocol 2a) that you get the case of an exposed object. In API1, exposing only a single function would mean writing a whole class (java-style) just containing one method. This seems like it should be much much easier to compose with other objects; e.g. into an AuthorizedRPCObject()
