Autobake: baking Autobahn into delicious 3.14159
=================================================

Minimal tests cases for [Autobahn](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython) in 
single files (which are easier to understand than the IoC-ful [examples](https://github.com/tavendo/AutobahnPython/tree/master/examples/twisted/wamp/basic)),
showing both PubSub and RPC patterns.

As Autobahn is [currently undergoing some growing pains](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/autobahnws/QagK8sDe22I/9nwHlx4I1UUJ)
the version of AutobahnJS that is known to work (0.9.0-3) is included inline here, so that if we update assets/libs/autobahn.js and suddenly find a regression we can at least compare agains a known working instance.
