# MySQL is picky about having abs paths everywhere in its config files

# This script complies with the hoops necessary to localize and isolate
# MySQL to a particular subdirectory (but without going so far as chrooting).
#
# Do not think of this as a script, think of it as the config file
# and remember that you use mysql --help --verbose to see the options you can set
# or look to https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/
# Strangely, not all options (like --user) are available here.

# usage: $ mysql.conf.sh PATH > mysql.conf
