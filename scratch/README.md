Experimental and demo code goes here. Before building something into mainline, put it here and try it out as a component.
Whenever you commit, try to ensure that something runs on first 'click' (whatever a 'click' is for your demo).
But since this isn't mainline that isn't as critical.

Because this is *experimental* code, copy dependencies (eg things in assets/libs) into your working dir,
so that a version bump in mainline doesn't break old code.

Try to write a README for each folder to help others track what your thinking is.
