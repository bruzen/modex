"""
postgres replication protocol messages
 as defined in http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol-replication.html
 called 'walsender' (for "Write-Ahead-Log Sender") mode by the postgres daemon.
 
 
Replication is a subprotocol, layered on outer layer messages:
 messages from the client are embedded in Queries, and
 messages from the server, in CopyDatas (except that the initial response to IDENTIFY_SYSTEM is a RowDescription/DataRow pair, which PgReplicationClient records but does not expose as a type),
 Note that all the other messages in the protocol are in principle still valid to receive while in 
 walsender mode; in particular, ErrorResponse is a very possible response.

    TODO:
    an open question: who owns who?
    should Repliaction_Message create a hidden CopyData and call its render()? 
    should Replication_Message be a *subclass* of CopyData? (but this can't work, because the inner .TYPECODE would stomp the outer one)
    or should there be an entirely separate tree of message types, parallel to but distinct from the messages.Message hierarchy?
    
    I've settled on for now on inheriting from Message but essentially having a parallel tree (which is not a big deal in python, whose notion of inheritence is pretty optional).
    Replication_Messages have TYPECODEs and SOURCEs as with Messages, and these get checked and used,
    but their payload() methods are expected to only construct the payload on the level of the replication protocol
    and the wrapping in Querys and unwrapping of CopyDatas handled silently in the client event loop.
