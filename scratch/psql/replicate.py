TODO:
 irritant: select() blocks ctrl-c, because it's an I/O wait (quick fix: give a long timeout on select and spin it in a polling loop)

clean up the sql injections


consider whether we can ditch SQLAlchemy; all this script does is issue simple SQL commands.
 speaking DBAPI directly would be less heavy
 

Concurrency bugs:
 by adding artificial stalls (time.sleep()) to the script, you can demonstrate these to yourself
 1) writes that occur after "cur = " but before "changes = " go to the great bit bucket in the sky
   solutions:
    a. figure out some way to ask postgres for timeline location id (xid)s and ask it to replay from those certain poitns
    b. Use an explicit table lock around acquiring the two cursors (NB: the changes cursor is not a SQL cursor)
      - http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-lock.html / http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/explicit-locking.html
 ...i think that's the only one. We could get the changes cursor first, and then be in the equally difficult situation of having double-writes (so, a delete would show up as a nonexistent row and then a delete which would get confused, an insert would show up as a duplicated row, an update would show up as both -- or maybe it would show up as unable to be applied since the old row would). If a human was doing this work, these sorts of errors would be manageable, but for a computer this is equally difficult.
  but since we make sure to (let the kernel) buffer changes for us simultaneously to the current state being written out, we should at least not miss anything in the gaps of writing out the current state.

  # 2) get a handle on the change stream beginning at the commit postgres was at *now* (?? maybe this involves locking?)
  #  XXX we're relying on the time between the select and Changes.__enter__() to be small enough to be atomically
  #   but that's never absolutely true so this has a race condition!
  #  It would be better if we could ask postgres
  #   "what is the lamport clock of our previous select", which postgres internally records [CITE: ....]
  #  And then say "with Changes(_table,[ columns,][ where,] from=clock)"
  # (NB: a lamport clock is a count of events; it has nothing to do with real time except that it always increases in time, making it suitable for synchronizing concurrent processes even when their system clocks might skew)
  # but postgres doesn't seem(?) to provide a way to extract; it just uses timelines to make sure every session sees a consistent set of data.
