scrap notes:

- the protocol is a mixture of binary and string data
- struct.(un)pack is useful for us for the binary data, but the string data is C-strings, which struct.pack does not handle (it handles fixed sized strings and pascal strings). This means we need to do scanning to parse these parts.
