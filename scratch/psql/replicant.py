"""
pure-python protoype of the sort of features we need in a (near-)real-time View.
The goal is to support dataflow (aka Functional Reactive aka actor) programming on top of SQL.
It is unfortunate that something like this does not already exist within postgres itself. At least,
I have not been able to find such a thing. Instead, this fronts onto postgres, using some stored procedure
shims which spool out all triggers.

This is in python3
watch.psql is mainly in python2
This awkwardness will be massaged out later.

Bugs:


goal: de-hardcode the query
 --> leave 'where' and 'columns' hardcoded to None (ie all) b/c those are unnecessary right now
 --? 
 
goal: stuff websockify in front of view_server ("viewd"? ) ;; maybe view is a bad name? it's a replication? it's "filtered replication".. or, what does FRP call this?
 --> pick better names... 

goal: think through how to rewrite this in terms of logical replication, and map out the pros/cons of that

goal: solve select() on a pipe is returning even when there is nothing to read, forcing me to use a polling loop
    write some experiments to test select() vs pipes
    
experiment with multicast UDP instead of mkfifo + teed

goal: clean up the internal server debugging prints, because I don't need those...

goal: document how to run / make running less stupid
 -> rename server.sh to db_server.sh and such; and db_server.sh should also kick initdb off if it hasn't run lately
 -> maybe use libpq environment variables (but then things are annoying to clean up..)
 
embed watch.psql into view.py 
 -> split it so that the watching function is loadable, and we (initially we can just always reload it)
 -> make the part that actually initially
  or possibly a better solution is to use DDL triggers so that every table has a watch on it...


bug: DELETE FROM table; doesn't flush its results immediately??

 i.e. there's (and possibly 
  ...well, the code that installs watchers is going to have to exist *somewhere*
   either it exists in something that speaks HTTP reading the URLs (flask? flask would be quick for this,
    and additionally, since there needs be only one of these processes per server, could just have an internal "i have installed the watcher on this table" table)

 to be clear:
  there's an HTTP process which manages o
  
  do I need to write
  
"./replicate server?? database?? table [columns] [where]"
 i think i dooo
 so i write that... then what?
 ^ this is the unix way..
^ "replicate" is basically this file; its output
then that... pipes stdout to.. somewhere????? ultimately it will need to have multiple teed
 is it even possible for me to construct native unix pipes between processes within python? I suppose I can do yet another bash wrapper script.
 oh, useful: websockify has a mode where it exec()s a process; ie it can websockify *either* an existing regular socket, or a program. maybe I don't need socat afterall.
  --> oh, but something about my build has this broken; which is fine, because the unix way would be that websockify does exactly one thing, which is to speak (and if you need something fancier, that's what (socat or nc) is for)
  a problem with websockify is that it ignores the path; in fact, the only thing it does with the HTTP path is a logging line:
```
              if self.path != '/':
                self.log_message("%s: Path: '%s'", client_addr, self.path)
```
 is it possible for me to do file descriptor handoff? I think so... fork+exec will hand off stdin and stdout to a new process; also, linux has an IPC hack called [???] which allows "sending" FDs to other processes if you need more than that.
 i want an HTTP server spinning, and *if* we decide that the incoming connection is for a replicant websocket, then I want to fork off to websockify speaking to
  ...wait; isn't websockify just basically
   ugh, problem is that unix sockets are *not* just pipes. because pipes read and write streams, and sockets were designed around packets; so you can't do fd; at least, you can't do it and have it work right. you need socat sitting in the middle. 
   
   server listen()s for HTTP
    and spins, handling HTTP requests
   and um
   if you are addressed to a replicant session (i.e. path is appropriate and), it [does stuff] then spawns a replicant.py
 (( the difference between replicant.py and the _changes stream is that replicant prefixes the *current* table state before sending; and, once we're past demo day and get to it, it will do filtering and delta compression and maybe even row-by-row compression (e.g. a set of rows all of which change name from 'a' to 'b' only need to be instructed to do such once)))
 ((later on, we'll do something clever with replicant.py such that, while each connected session receives a unique prefix of rows, the changes stream is only computed once per combination of parameters))
 
 i want the kernel to do this. i *do not want* to write "loop: write(output, read(input))" because that pulls the data through a buffer in userland; if i must write that, then i want it to be contained in socat, which has been designed to do this very well.
 
 another irritant of websockify is that it insists on 'binary' or 'base64' encoding; but I've used websockets just sending strings back and forth and had it behave itself fine.
 
or do I have to do
source = replicate("ws://server/replicant/", "databasename", "tablename", columns, where)
corresponding to
w.send('{"db": "databasename", "table": "tablename", "columns": "columns", "where": where}') //NB: 'where' is not spec'd yet; in fact, I am going to leave it unspecced because spec'ing it means redefining SQL or doing some sort of awkward exposure of SQL to the front end

^ this is easier for me right now, so I'm going to do this. 
 the other way is better because knowing that a table watcher has been installed isn't as finicky
 
 
 
 
Sketch of Components:
* watchers: the shim of code which gets extracts database updates to a FIFO;
   currently implemented as a python stored procedure
   When pg9.4 is released, could be implemented by Logical Replication, though that requires editing a config file instead of just loading some .sql
* replicants: the code which accepts a client session and feeds out changes to a particular slice
  Currently implemented in python, and our slice is only (table,), though (database, table, columns, where)
* websocket bridge: something which connects
  implementation: some combination of websockify + socat 
* database: postgres 9.x, in our case
* simulation(s): a concurrent process which feeds the database; writes (inserts, updates, and deletes (though, for scientific purposes, we should almost never be using updates or deletes; any time we need to go over old territory, instead we should just generate a new simulation ID and append that to all rows)) that the simulation causes should be reflected immediately in the database -> watcher -> replicant -> client chain

* clients: clients watch the database state by opening a websocket to the bridge
    through an out of band means (e.g. another websocket, likely), clients can control the simulation and hence, indirectly, the values they read from the database. However, the simulation+database

    A View is a slice of a database. For example, "all farms or farmers who existed before 1944".
    This implementation is special because it is dynamic. It takes a stream of changes,
    filters them, and then provides a smaller stream of changes which consumers
     up to date in real time with the state of the view.
    In other words, this implements filtered replication ([like CouchDB](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/replication/intro.html#controlling-which-documents-to-replicate)),
    but for SQL.
    Standard views in SQL regenerate every time they are queried, and similarly Postgres's MATERIALIZED VIEWS (basically a cached view) can only be refreshed once they are stale with a full rescan.
     All it needs is some water and a source of row-level change events
     (e.g. as prototyped in watch.psql).
     

    
    LIMITING ASSUMPTIONS:
    * the source of change events feeds full rows
    * the only sorts of changes are inserts, updates, deletes
    * the schema never changes
    * ..but the schema is also never explicitly stated (and the end target is d3-style array-of-rows JSON)
    * you can only slice tables, not databases, with this (ie there are no JOINs or other fancy operators)
    
    TODO:
    * Optimizations
      * [ ] If that table has a primary key, deletes can be compressed to just send that
      * [ ] Updates can be compressed be removing the common terms
      * Ideally, this feature would be fast, in C, inside of Postgres, triggering on updates to parents of MATERIALIZED VIEWS, and would properly handle the full range of SQL (JOINs, SET a = a + 1, etc).
