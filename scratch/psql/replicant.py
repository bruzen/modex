# implement the client side of http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol-flow.html#AEN98939
# the reason I'm doing this is because I want to use http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol-replication.html *over a websocket*, and, personally, it's easier to prototype with python

"""
scrap notes:

- the protocol is a mixture of binary and string data
- struct.(un)pack is useful for us for the binary data, but the string data is C-strings, which struct.pack does not handle (it handles fixed sized strings and pascal strings). This means we need to do scanning to parse these parts.
- the possible messages at http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol-message-formats.html; this prototype focuses on the client protocol, meaning only ones marked "B"(ackend) have parse() written and only ones marked "F"(rontend) have payload() written

A single request can result in multiple responses, which sometimes come in a particular order and sometimes do not.
