scrap notes:

- the protocol is a mixture of binary and string data
- struct.(un)pack is useful for us for the binary data, but the string data is C-strings, which struct.pack does not handle (it handles fixed sized strings and pascal strings). This means we need to do scanning to parse these parts.

        # dealing with this protocol is complicated because it's not a simple request-response protocol. A single request can result in multiple responses, which sometimes come in a particular order and sometimes do not. We're facing a state machine, and that makes it difficult to write cleanly (i.e. functionally).
        # e.g. a single response to a query is at least three messages:
        # 1) a RowDescription, giving the fieldnames and order (in csv, the first header row)
        # 2) a series of DataRows
        # 3) a CommandComplete
        
        # It's *also* complicated because there's layered protocols, though they aren't called that
        # for example, the "walsender" mode is layered on SQL messages ("Q"ueries and "D"/"C" responses); like, IDENTIFY_SYSTEM returns a SQL table, even though it's metadata that isn't actually SQL.
        # Maybe we should actually implement some lines here, like "while Reading A Query Response: m = self.recv(); ..." and..stream out the result to a queue of some sort? a queue labelled by the table name or ..something? oh, but even more complicated for us, the protocol does not embed table names in the responses.
