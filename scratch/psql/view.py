class View(object):
    """
    A View is a slice of a database. For example, "all farms or farmers who existed before 1944".
    This implementation is special because it is dynamic. It takes a stream of changes,
    filters them, and then provides a smaller stream of changes which consumers
     up to date in real time with the state of the view.
    In other words, this implements filtered replication ([like CouchDB](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/replication/intro.html#controlling-which-documents-to-replicate)),
    but for SQL.
    Standard views in SQL regenerate every time they are queried, and similarly Postgres's MATERIALIZED VIEWS (basically a cached view) can only be refreshed once they are stale with a full rescan.
     All it needs is some water and a source of row-level change events
     (e.g. as prototyped in watch.psql).
     

    
    LIMITING ASSUMPTIONS:
    * the source of change events feeds full rows
    * the only sorts of changes are inserts, updates, deletes
    * the schema never changes
    * ..but the schema is also never explicitly stated (and the end target is d3-style array-of-rows JSON)
    * you can only slice tables, not databases, with this (ie there are no JOINs or other fancy operators)
    
    TODO:
    * Optimizations
      * [ ] If that table has a primary key, deletes can be compressed to just send that
      * [ ] Updates can be compressed be removing the common terms
      * Ideally, this feature would be fast, in C, inside of Postgres, triggering on updates to parents of MATERIALIZED VIEWS, and would properly handle the full range of SQL (JOINs, SET a = a + 1, etc).
