 QGIS Cheatsheet 
  you can NOT map symbols onto polygon layers. duh
  
  you have some small amount of ability to compose symbolology: fills, borders, and symbols
  the default symbologies for category mode are *all* gradient. to map data that aren't ordinal the secret is to click Color Ramp, scroll all the way down, and choose "New Color Ramp" and THEN you get the "random" and "ColorBrewer" options
  
  to make layers (eg to make clipping layers to filter data)
   add a new empty layer with Layer -> New -> Shapefile
   click "Toggle Editing" which probably is living on the bottomleft toolbar
