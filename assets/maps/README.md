# Map Data

Here lies all of our static map content. GIS data is getting more open, but it is expensive to produce and the owners tend to cling to it closely.

**Thus:**

a. some of these maps are not in the git repo (and are explicitly disallowed by the .gitignore in this folder) and you'll need to source them from a team member after signing the appropriate data release forms.
a. for open data we do have, the license MUST clearly be stated. Hence, every dataset D.dat is shadowed by a D.dat.license file. **DO NOT commit a dataset without also committing its license terms.**
