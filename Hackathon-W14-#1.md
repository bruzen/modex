**Date**: January 19th, 2014, 2pm, EWB office

**Attendees**: n7wilson, kousu, majdal

**Goals** for the end of the day:

1. Be able to launch a (twisted) server taking as arguments N files (including N=0) containing vector geodata (GDAL should allow us to be agnostic about this) and load them up
2. Pass these geodata layers to the frontend over a websocket and have them rendered overtop of the OpenLayers basemap--the frontend should distinguish between
3. Make sure the frontend *only* loads the geodata for the tile---OpenLayers handles this for rasters properly (by asking a tile server for an 'z/x/y' file) but we're not sure if it does something similar with vectors or if we need to implement that ourselves --- this might require emailing the ol3 devs and asking them what their plan is
4. Write a hook that implements the 'identify' button: ol3 provides hooks for clicking on vectors on the map, so we want a way to click on them and then ask the backend for what that iesult is and display it somewhere, like on a spare &lt;p&gt; tag sitting below the map. This is our **UI _prototype_**.

1. Provide a d3 canvas on the frontend and a corresponding (over a websocket) feed from the backend giving a stream of numbers (for testing, use something simple like a gaussian or a sin function). This is our **indicator variable _prototype_**.
  * investigate whether it makes sense to multiplex events over the same socket, perhaps with Autobahn

**Extensions** if there's time left over after all that:

1. write a skeleton farm model. This probably means reimplementing [FarmSimulationModel](https://github.com/n7wilson/FoodSimulationModel) on top of GDAL. Initially, just write it in the same server as the rest; we'll figure out how to factor out the model from the explorer later ((and ideally the model doesn't have to be in python to work))
1. Investigate (and document in the src/ dir!) what it takes to create raster sources for. Can we get our twisted server to host an http endpoint producing (dynamically, even) XYZ maps
