# About #
This is a framework to modify things! 

-----

# Requirements #
* Python 2.x

# Installation #
1. Clone the repository:  `git clone <your_username>@162.243.54.234:/repos/modex.git`
> If you're on Ubuntu, use install the following packages `sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev`
> If you're on OSX, make sure that you have Xcode installed, and up to date, including commandline tools
> If you're on Windows, `pip` sometimes doesn't install Twisted correctly. Installing it separately might solve the problem. 
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
> We installed Twisted seperately, but you might not have to!

# Running #
To run the server, run `python run.py` in the terminal. A new browser window should open automatically, pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
